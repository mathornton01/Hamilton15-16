<p> <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quest-for-quantum-computers-heats-up/">This</a> Scientific American article discuses current advanced made in quantum computation and describes the state of quantum computation as having no further theoretical land blocks, and being totally dependent upon engineers implementing quantum circuits. <a href="http://www.dwavesys.com/">This</a> company is one of the first that "claims" to have been able to create a Quantum computer.</p>

<p>MIT has a really wonderful introduction to Quantum computation that is very accessible and explains some of the most basic concepts in quantum computation in a very nice format <a href="
http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/quantum-computing"> here</a>. Although there are many excellent resources out there for learning the basics of quantum computation. I have found that there seems to be a small dichotomy between Quantum Physics and Quantum Information Processing, and although I have not had a very significant journey into the world of quantum physics, but that hasn't substantially handicapped me in terms of my ability to understand quantum information processing.</p>

<p>The mathematics used in quantum computation are fairly straight-forward it is really just simple linear algebra. The main difference in this and other types of linear algebra is the specific kiund of notation that is used. Although there is nothing particularly novel except the notation that is used, it was developed by the physicist Paul Dirac a good introduction is here <a href="./braket.pdf"> here </a> there is a little bit more condensed guide that does not contain some of the examples from the first document <a href="./hbraket.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to what was already mentioned the father of Quantum Computing Dr. David Deutch has created several introductory videos that can be viewed <a href="http://www.quiprocone.org/Protected/DD_lectures.htm">here</a> </p>
