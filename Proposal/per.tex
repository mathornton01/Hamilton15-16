Micah Thornton is a dedicated triple-major, studying Mathematics,
Statistics, and Computer Engineering, as well as working toward
Master's in Electrical Engineering.  Having already succesfully
completed a Quantum Computing course, as well as upper level math and
computer science classes, Micah is eager to get underway with this
project.

Professor Daniel Reynolds is an associate professor of Mathematics,
with expertise in high-performance scientific computing and advanced
numerical methods.  While Prof. Reynolds does not have experience in
quantum computing, he will provide guidance on numerical method
selection and algorithm modification to utilize combinational logic.
Prof. Reynolds has successfully mentored multiple previous Hamilton
scholars, Master's and Ph.D. students in computational mathematics,
and is eager to pursue this research project.
