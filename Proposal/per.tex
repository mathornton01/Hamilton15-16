No project would be succesful without a dedicated team of people to work on it, and this is no exception. 

Micah Thornton is a dedicated student, who is pursuing three degrees in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Engineering, as well as a masters in Electrical Engineering. Having already succesfully completed a Quantum Computing course, as well as upper level math, and computer science classes, Micah is eager to get underway with this project. 

Professor Daniel Reynolds is an associate professor of Mathematics, with expertise in high-performance scientific computing and advanced numerical methods.  While Prof. Reynolds does not have experience in quantum computing, he will provide guidance on numerical method selection and algorithm modification to utilize combinational logic.  Prof. Reynolds has successfully mentored multiple previous Hamilton scholars, Master's and Ph.D. students in computational mathematics, and is eager to pursue this research project.
