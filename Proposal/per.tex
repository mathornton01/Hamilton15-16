No project would be succesful without a dedicated team of people to work on it, and this is no exception. 

Micah Thornton is a dedicated student, who is pursuing three degrees in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Engineering, as well as a masters in Electrical Engineering. Having already succesfully completed a Quantum Computing course, as well as upper level math, and computer science classes, Micah is eager to get underway with this project.
